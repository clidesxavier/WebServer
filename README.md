# WebServer

//Description:
Single-Threaded Web Server Development Project (Early Stage).

During my time at 86_Bootcamp, I embarked on a challenging project to develop a single-threaded web server from the ground up. While still in its early stages, this project demonstrates my skills in server-side programming, system architecture, and web server development.

//Highlights (Current):

Web Server Creation: The core focus of this project is to create a functional web server capable of handling HTTP requests and serving web pages to clients. The current implementation follows a single-threaded approach.

Basic Request Handling: The server can accept incoming HTTP requests and respond with a basic "Hello World!" message. This provides a foundation for further development.

Technology Integration: The project involves integrating essential technologies, including socket programming and HTTP protocols, to establish the core functionality of the web server.

Technologies Used (Current):

Java for server-side development
Socket programming for network communication
Single-threaded architecture for request handling
HTTP protocols for basic request processing
Future Plans:
While the project is in its early stage and lacks advanced features such as security measures and a database, future plans include:

Implementing security measures, including input validation and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
Developing a database component to store and retrieve data for dynamic web content.
Expanding the server's functionality to support more complex HTTP requests and dynamic content generation.
Incorporating logging and error handling mechanisms to enhance server reliability and monitoring.
